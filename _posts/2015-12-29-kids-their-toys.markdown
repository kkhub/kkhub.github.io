I have a two year old daughter, Aura. She just turned two, and i was thinking i should get her a gift. On that thought, I really really try not to swamp her with too many toys at home. I feel, this generation (Indian) parents buy too many toys for their kids. When i think about it, obviously this generation parents have a lot of money to spend than the previous. There are also other reasons i hear from my friends like, "I didn't get to play with many toys so i want my son/daughter to have that fun since i could afford". I don't think that's a bad reason, but somehow i don't agree. You don't do something because you can, you do only if thats right thing to do. I also feel sometimes we just buy toys to make ourself feel better since we spend less and less time with them. Aura just have few toys and she seems to be perfectly fine with it. I think she values what she has and thats my point, if you have too many of anything you aren't going to value it. 

I also hear some sentiments from people i know, "Oh he/she liked it, i have to get it for him/her". but do you want to get whatever your kid wants, or get what you think is good for them ?

Anyways, Thats just my opinion and i make my life choices based on that. Please share your thoughts and opinions.
